jStorage is a simple wrapper plugin for Prototype, MooTools and jQuery to store data on
browser side and to replace the use of cookies for storing data.

jStorage is able to save almost any kind of data (strings, numbers, objects, even XML nodes)
only object methods and functions are left out.

jStorage makes use of HTML5 local storage where available and userData behavior in 
Internet Explorer older versions. Webkit SQLite is not supported.

Current availability: jStorage supports all major browsers - Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2+, 
Safari 4+, Chrome 4+, Opera 10.50+

If the browser doesn't support data caching, then no exceptions are raised - jStorage can still 
be used by the script but nothing is actually stored.
 	
jStorage is really small, just 2 kB when minified!
